A highly available, ActivityPub-powered commenting system that bridges the gap
between web comments and the Fediverse. Perfect for blogs looking to engage with
Mastodon and other ActivityPub-compatible platforms.

> The name "Pinka" comes from the [Lojban
> word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Lojban/pinka) meaning "to
> comment" (x₁ is a comment/remark about subject x₂ expressed by x₃ to audience
> x₄). This reflects both the project's core purpose and its systematic approach
> to federated communications.

> [!WARNING]
> Pinka is still under active development. The database schema might change between
> minor versions. See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for currently implemented features.

> [!NOTE]
> Federating with Mastodon mostly works now!
