# Pinka 0.1.0-beta.1 is released!

We are thrilled to announce the release of Pinka 0.1.0-beta.1! This marks a
significant milestone as we move closer to a stable release. Pinka is now ready
for testing integration with static site generators, making it easier than ever
to add federated commenting to your static websites.

of Pinka. Here are some of the key features and improvements:

- **ActivityPub integration**: Seamless federation with Mastodon and other Fediverse platforms.
- **Enhanced delivery mechanism**: More robust retry mechanisms for failed deliveries.
- **Improved error reporting**: Better logging and error handling to help diagnose issues quickly.
